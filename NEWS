VM 8.0.7

  BUGFIXES:

    * Disable only those minor modes listed in the variable
      `vm-disable-modes-before-encoding' before encoding a
      composition. (Thanks to Alley for reporting and debugging)

    * Removed recursion from function `vm' added by 8.0.6, as it 
      causes startup troubles.

    * Removed extra newline before attachment buttons. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting)

    * Removed wrongly used calls to `interactive-p'. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting and debugging)

VM 8.0.6

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Rewrote INSTALL to be more consistent and more understandable.

    * Allow defadvice on function `vm' by recursing on session start. (Thanks
      to Blueman for the code)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Ignore empty reply-to in `vm-ignored-reply-to'.

    * Quoted the variable `vm-summary-format' in a doc string.

    * Fixed typos in the docstring of `vm-mail-send-and-exit'.

    * Disable all minor modes before encoding a composition.  This results in
      faster encoding when font-lock was enabled and avoids problems when
      parts of a MIME object button get expanded due to an abbrev and thus the
      extent/overlay gets split into two separate parts causing an encoding
      error.

    * Avoid duplicate mime buttons during decoding. (Thanks to Alley for
      reporting)

    * Mask 8 bit chars by 0xff in `vm-mime-qp-encode-region' to avoid crash
      for those with all higher order bits set (negative ones?) (Thanks to
      Blueman for the fix.)

VM 8.0.5

  BUGFIXES:

    * Fixed bug caused by fixing `vm-drop-buffer-name-chars' in 8.0.4.  There
      is a 20-40% chance to create a new bug when fixing one.  Regression
      tests would be nice, but we do not have any for VM ;-/

VM 8.0.4

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Require cl.el at compile-time only. (Thanks to John J. Foerch)

    * Quiet compiler warning about old style backquotes. (Thanks to John
      J. Foerch)

  BUGFIXES:

    * Correctly call custom-add-load. (Thanks to John J. Foerch and
      Jonathan.underwood) 

    * Fixed building of vm-cus-load.el for Emacs 21.

    * Use the old default for `vm-primary-inbox', i.e. "~/INBOX".

    * Honor a t in `vm-drop-buffer-name-chars' as documented.

VM 8.0.3

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Unified `vm-continue-what-message', i.e. first check for composition
      buffers, if none exist then for saved drafts.  Also added new variable
      `vm-zero-drafts-start-compose'.

  BUGFIXES:

    * Fixed building of autoloads for GNU Emacs.

    * Docfixes for vm-pine.el (Thanks to Stephen Eglen).

    * Resurrected `vm-add-reply-subject-prefix' which was lost by the commit
      of revno 91.

    * Search for BZR only if bzrdir exists and use locate-file only when
      defined.

    * Use  vm-mime-8bit-composition-charset as a fallback also for MULE Emacs.

    * Fixed defcustom of vm-keep-crash-boxes and vm-spool-files.

    * Fixed the section headers of the NEWS file.

VM 8.0.2

  IMPROVEMENTS:

    * Added --with-pixmapdir to configure the location of the pixmaps.

    * DESTDIR-Patch (Ulrich Mueller).

  BUGFIXES:

    * Avoid overflow of `buffer-undo-list' when inserting or encoding
      big attachments.

    * defcustom of `vm-mime-all-attachments-directory' should list nil.

    * Honor pre VM 8.0.0 values of `vm-folder-directory' and
      `vm-primary-inbox'. This should eliminate problems with users which
      never changed the defaults. 

    * Use "cygwin-mount" to fix paths when available.

    * Activate summary faces only when requested by vm-enable-addons.

    * Fixed defcustom of `vm-enable-addons' and added documentation.

    * "make install" creates $(bindir) now.

    * Separate paths (e.g. otherdirs) only by semicolons to avoid problems on
      Win32.

    * Handle paths with spaces correctly.

    * Install also pixmaps for GTK enabled Emacs.

    * Just use the first subject when replying/forwarding to a set of
      messages.  This avoids long filenames for saved composition buffers.
    
    * Ensure we are compiling with an emacs version >= 21.

    * Encode headers regexp and case-fold-search corrected. (Ulrich Mueller)

    * vm-summary-faces-mode does not leak extents anymore.

VM 8.0.1

  NOTES:

    In order to get more features from vm-rfaddons set the variable
    `vm-enable-addons' in your ~/.vm.

  BUGFIXES:

    * A saner default for vm-shrunken-header-face.

    * Added documentation on vm-shrunken-headers-face and
      vm-shrunken-headers-keymap.

    * Added a new custom group `vm-faces' for faces.

    * Added autoload token for vm-user-agent.

    * Use INSTALL_PROGRAM instead of INSTALL_DATA for programs.

    * Do not set vm-folder-directory if there is ~/INBOX.  If VM does not get
      mail after upgrading from 7.19 it is probably due to the new default for
      vm-folder-directory, which was nil before.

    * Revised the bindings and enabled features to a hopefully less
      controversial setting. 

VM 8.0.0

  NOTES:

    VM is now in my hands and I will do my best to keep it alive!

    | Yes.  Obviously I've moved on, though I've been slow to admit it
    | to myself.  Good luck.
    `--------------------------------------------------------------------------
	   
    * My (robf) VM extensions are now activated by default, where it makes
      sense to me.

    * Releases are numbered now MAJOR.MINOR.PATCHLEVEL, where MAJOR is
      increased when fundamental changes occur, MINOR for new features and
      PATCHLEVEL for bugfix releases.

    * New cleaner source tree layout.

    * Better built system based on configure.  Autoloads are generated only
      for those functions marked with the autoload token now, which are mainly
      interactive function. Thus, loading occurs only on demand and startup
      should be faster.
      
  BUGFIXES:

    * All bugs reported to gnu.emacs.vm.bugs, gnu.emacs.vm.info and directly
      to me are fixed either by the patches posted by others or me.

    * If there are any missing autoloads, please report them and add a
      (require 'vm-SOURCE) to your ~/.vm!

    * Probably added numerous new bugs.


  IMPROVEMENTS: compared to 7.19 (not vmrf)

    * A new icon set based on vm-small-pixmaps.tgz which was floating around.
      This one should fit by height to the one used in XEmacs and Emacs 22,
      but it is slightly larger than those used in Emacs 21.  If you see the
      old icons, the please set the variables `vm-image-directory' and
      `vm-toolbar-pixmap-directory' to nil in your ~/.vm!

    * vm-mime-type-converter-alist now also works when replying to messages,
      i.e. for text/html one can use lynx or w3m for the conversion.
      (setq vm-mime-type-converter-alist
	'(("text/html" "text/plain" "lynx -force_html -dump /dev/stdin")))

    * Postponing (draft handling) of compositions and continuing of drafts, in
      fact any messages also those from other people. (Info node: Sending
      Messages) 

    * New mail header insertion functions for return-receipts, mail-priority
      and FCC.

    * More virtual folder selectors and replacements of other functions based
      on selectors. (Info node: Virtual Folders)

    * vm-serial.el provides message templates for composition and
      personalizes mass emails. (Info node: TODO)
    
    * vm-biff.el for popups with a list of new messages.

    * vm-rfaddons.el has various stuff, look at the source if you are curious
      or miss some VM feature, as it might already be there!
