vm (8.0.12-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * This version of VM does not work with Emacs 21 and lower, since those
    versions are missing the custom-autoload function which is used
    invm-autoloads.el.  As a result, no autoloads for vm are defined,
    making vm completely unusable with emacs21. VM no longer byte compiles
    itself for those versions.
