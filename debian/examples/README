The files dot.vm, dot.emacs and dot.abbrevs are mine; dot.vm.2 was
contributed by a friend as an alternative example.  Edit them to your
personal requirements before trying to use them!

If there is demand it should be trivial to write a program to
translate between other addressbook formats and the abbrev file
format.  (There's no reason you have to use abbrevs for your address
book, but I like it;-)

README.windows, full_screen and summary_{bottom,right,top} are from
the windows package distributed with the upstream vm source.
